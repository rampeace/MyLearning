🔹 Only the control itself needs to know	Direct
🔹 You want parents to respond to child actions (like clicks)	Bubbling
🔹 You want parents to intercept or cancel things before they reach the child	Tunneling

Tunneling

🧠 Guidelines to Choose Event Strategy
1. Use Direct if:
The event is local-only to the control.

No one else should respond unless explicitly hooked to that instance.

🔸 Examples: Loaded, SizeChanged, IsVisibleChanged

2. Use Bubbling if:
The event originates in a child (your control) but might be handled in a parent (like a container).

You want to allow event aggregation, analytics, or general UI logic at a higher level.

🔸 Examples: Click, MouseDown, TextChanged

3. Use Tunneling if:
You want containers or parent UI to get first chance at handling the event before the control does.

Great for previewing, validation, interception, or disabling behavior globally.

🔸 Examples: PreviewMouseDown, PreviewKeyDown
