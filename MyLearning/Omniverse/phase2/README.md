# Phase 2 - USD Core Engineering

Goal: create a USD stage programmatically (root prims, layers) and save it.

What this includes:
- A new stage with `/World` as the default prim.
- A sublayer (`overrides.usda`) to demonstrate composition ordering.
- A small override authored in the sublayer.

Run:
`python phase2/main.py`
