# Omniverse Learning

This folder is my personal workspace for learning NVIDIA Omniverse.
I use it to capture notes, experiments, and small prototypes as I
explore the tools, APIs, and workflows.

## Intent
- Keep everything related to Omniverse learning in one place.
- Track progress over time with lightweight notes and examples.
- Make it easy to revisit and build on earlier experiments.

## What goes here
- Notes and summaries from docs, videos, or courses.
- Small demo projects or scripts.
- Configuration snippets and troubleshooting tips.

## What does not go here
- Large binary assets (store elsewhere and link if needed).
- Work-in-progress items unrelated to Omniverse.
